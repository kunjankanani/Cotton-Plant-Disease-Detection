# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Detection

## Abstract

Cotton is an important crop with a significant role in the global economy, but it is susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early detection and diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for efficient crop management and reducing economic losses. In this project, we propose a deep learning-based approach for cotton disease prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system is designed to classify six different types of cotton diseases based on their visual symptoms. A large dataset of cotton plant images infected with various diseases was collected and used to train and evaluate the CNN model. The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Transfer learning was applied to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN model for the specific classification task. The proposed system achieved an impressive overall accuracy of 98% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting cotton diseases. This system has the potential to serve as a reliable tool for early detection and diagnosis of cotton diseases, thereby improving crop management practices and reducing economic losses.
